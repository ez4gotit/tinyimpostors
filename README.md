This small tool for Unity inspired by Nvidia GPU Gems which i personaly recommend.

### Repo Map:

main____       // You are here

        |
        
        stable // The feature-cutted, but stable (probably) version.
        
        |
        
        scratch // Trashcan for all untested ideas or half-working solutions


### How to:

1) Download the Archive from `stable` and move the folder `Impostors` to the root of your `Assets` folder.
2) Remove all the objects from the background which do not have to be baked.
3) Open the `Tools` -> `Impostors Baker` (Name in context menu may differ) and Bake.


### TODO's

TODO: Fix Normal map

TODO: Implement Lightning and virtual shadows.

TODO: Move from Atlas to ArrayTexture

TODO: Unity Package

TODO: Masks to bake only child meshes.

TODO: ???

NOTE: This Repo is really raw yet, i would upload features "by bits" while some of features are not tested yet so not sure they worth to be.
